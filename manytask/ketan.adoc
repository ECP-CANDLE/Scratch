Instructions for benchmark on Summitdev:

.  Edit run-swift-sdev.sh to
.. set PROJECT
.. set Swift/T location (if needed)
. Run:
----
$ export PROCS=16 PPN=16
$ ./run-swift-sdev.sh loop.swift -n=$((PROCS*2))
----

This will run loop.swift

Try to run as many PROCS as possible, by powers of 2: 16,32,...
Ideally get to 4K or so.

Then share the output directories with me.
